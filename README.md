Front end for Better Friend Reminders


"Pitch: I can never remember my friend's and family member's birthdays/anniversaries etc. I need an app that allows me to enter in all my important dates by category and automatically blast out texts on my loved one's special days. Never miss a special day for a friend or family member ever again!

MVP: As a user I want to login and see a list of automated messages that I have previously set up so I can click on a message and edit or delete it. As a user I want to be able to create an autmated message to a friend. A message should include a send date and time and a long text field that enables the message curator the ability to send a custom message.

Stretch:  (Mobile App) - Allow contact prospecting to migrate your contacts into the app. 
(Web App) - Allow for a social media sharing aspect that allows you to advertise the app on your social media platform of choice."
