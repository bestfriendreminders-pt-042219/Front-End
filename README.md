Front end for Better Friend Reminders


## BUGS ##
**[x] Delete function does not referesh after being passed -  "Please provide a valid reminder id" - sent flag is - needs CDU function**
**[ ] Show all categories with filter/ reference UI for the select box**
**[ ] Adjust send date format**
**[ ] Create some kind of visualization for a sent message**



**[x] Require all info in message form**
**[x] Can't update reminder**
**[NA] Can't search reminder**
**[ ] Login Button Showing When Logged In**
**[ ] No styling**
**[ ] Links aren't arranged properly**


## Requirements ##
**"Pitch: I can never remember my friend's and family member's birthdays/anniversaries etc. I need an app that allows me to enter in all my important dates by category and automatically blast out texts on my loved one's special days. Never miss a special day for a friend or family member ever again!**

**[x] MVP: As a user I want to [x]login and see a [x]list of automated messages that I have previously set up so I can click on a message and [x]edit or [x]delete it. As a user I want to be able to [x]create an autmated message to a friend. A message should include a [x]send date and time and a [x]long text field that enables the message curator the [?]ability to send a custom message.**

**Stretch:[ ] (Mobile App) - [ ]Allow contact prospecting to migrate your contacts into the app. (Web App) - [ ]Allow for a social media sharing aspect that allows you to advertise the app on your social media platform of choice."**

=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
