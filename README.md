## Requirements ##
**"Pitch: I can never remember my friend's and family member's birthdays/anniversaries etc. I need an app that allows me to enter in all my important dates by category and automatically blast out texts on my loved one's special days. Never miss a special day for a friend or family member ever again!**

**[x] MVP: As a user I want to [x]login and see a [x]list of automated messages that I have previously set up so I can click on a message and [x]edit or [x]delete it. As a user I want to be able to [x]create an autmated message to a friend. A message should include a [x]send date and time and a [x]long text field that enables the message curator the [?]ability to send a custom message.**

**Stretch:[ ] (Mobile App) - [ ]Allow contact prospecting to migrate your contacts into the app. (Web App) - [ ]Allow for a social media sharing aspect that allows you to advertise the app on your social media platform of choice."**
